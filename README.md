<h2>🪧About Me</h2>
My Name is Christina and I am 29 years old aspiring to be a Data Analyst. I graduated from University of Toronto with an Honours Bachelors of Arts and Science with a Physics Specialist and a Math Minor. I have been coding since undergrad modeling mostly for physics and mathematics. I have working experience in data modeling during my time at Partner Reinsurance using programs such as R and SQL; my time there solidified my passion for data analytics. <br>

<h2>🎯 Goals</h2>

* Become a self sufficient Data Analyst and, if possible, branch to Data Science and/or Engineering
