My Name is Christina and I am 29 years old aspiring to be a Data Analyst.

I have been coding since undergrad modeling mostly for physics and mathematics. I have working experience in data modeling during my time at Partner Reinsurance using programs such as R and SQL; my time there solidified my passion for data analytics. <br>
